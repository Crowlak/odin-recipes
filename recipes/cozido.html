        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li> In a big pan with water, drop the stock cubes, salt, 4 cloves and Portuguese chourizos. 
                    Let it boil.</li>
                <li>Wash the meats. Add the beef, the pork belly, ear and paw.
                    Let it cook. (Each meat has different cooking times. 
                    From first to last to be ready: pork belly - ear and paw – beef).</li>
                <li>Wash the vegetables. Once done cooking, remove the meats onto a tray
                    (if you’re following the video, the chef removes the meats separately
                    due to the different cook times of each meat).
                    Add the cabbage and the kale onto the stew and let it boil for 5 minutes.
                    Add the rice blood sausage, 
                    the turnips and the carrots cut in four pieces.
                    Let it boil for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in another pan,
                    put the rice and add the broth from cooking the meats.
                    Let it cook.
                    Add the potatoes cut in half onto the pan with the turnips and carrots.
                    With a toothpick, make holes on the farinheiras 
                    and the remaining blood sausage and add them to the turnip pan.
                    After 4 minutes, remove the blood sausage (without rice).</li>
                <li>Take a bit of the broth to a third pan and add the beans.
                    Let it boil for 2 minutes to heat them up properly.
                    After everything is done cooking, cut the meats
                    (in the video, the chef does it while waiting 
                    for the vegetables to be done – personal preference) and serve in trays.</li>
            </ol>
