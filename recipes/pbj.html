        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A personal favourite of mine I discovered fairly recently. 
            Living in Portugal, peanut butter isn't as common as in the US so PBJ even less so.
            But, oh, is it so good!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>3 slices bread </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fruit preserves, any flavor </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Toast 1 bread slice, allow to cool.</li>
                <li>Spread one side of each of the two remaining slices with preserves.</li>
                <li>Spread both sides of the toasted slice with peanut butter.</li>
                <li>Form a sandwich with the toasted slice in the center.</li>
            </ol>
